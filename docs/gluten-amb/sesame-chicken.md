# Sesame chicken

[Dinner At the Zoo](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/lighter-honey-sesame-chicken/)

## Ingredients

### Chicken

 * 1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into small pieces (aka one normal size package of chicken breasts)
 * 2 eggs
 * salt and pepper (optional)
 * 1/2 cup flour
 * 1/2 cup cornstarch
 * Oil (Canola/Vegetable) for frying

### Sauce

 * 1 tsp oil (any)
 * 1 tsp minced garlic (aka 1 to 2 cloves)
 * 1/4 cup honey
 * 1/3 cup soy sauce
 * 1/2 cup ketchup
 * 3 tbsp brown sugar
 * 2 tbsp rice vinegar
 * 1.5 tbsp sesame oil

### Toppings

 * 1 tbsp sesame seeds
 * 2 tbsp sliced green onions

## Instructions

 * Dip each piece of chicken in egg, then in flour and cornstarch mixture
 * Fry in vegetable/canola oil until golden brown on boh sides, about 5 minutes per side.
 * Take chicken out and let dry on cooling racks
 * Fry garlic in oil in small saucepan for 30 seconds to a minute. Add remaining sauce ingredients and simmer until sauce thickens
 * Add chicken back to frying pan, stir in half the sauce, and top with sesame seeds and green onions. Serve with remaining sauce on the side.

## Notes

 * It also works to omit the eggs, and just toss the chicken in flour and salt + pepper. The chicken will be less crispy, but it will also absorb less oil.
