https://theloopywhisk.com/2018/10/14/ultimate-gluten-free-chocolate-cake/


## Ingredients

### Sponge

* 2 cups + 3 tbsp (265 g) plain gluten free flour blend (I've used a simple store-bought blend containing only rice, potato and maize flours, with no added xanthan gum)
* 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
* 3/8 cup + 1/2 tbsp (50 g) cocoa powder
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 1/2 cups (300 g) granulated sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 1 cup + 2 tsp (250 mL) milk, room temperature
* 1/2 cup + 1 tsp (125 mL) vegetable or sunflower oil
* 1 cup + 2 tsp (250 mL) boiling hot water

### Chocolate buttercream frosting

* 3 sticks (340 g) unsalted butter, softened
* 2 cups (250 g) powdered sugar
* 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp (75 g) cocoa powder
* pinch of salt
* 5 1/3 oz (150 g) dark chocolate, melted and cooled

## Instructions

### Sponge

* Pre-heat the oven to 355 ºF (180 ºC) and line two 7 inch round cake pans with greaseproof/baking paper.
* In a large bowl, sift together the gluten free flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda and cocoa powder.
* Add the granulated sugar and salt, and whisk well.
* Add the eggs, milk and vegetable/sunflower oil. Whisk well, until you get a smooth cake batter.
* Add the boiling hot water, and whisk until you get a runny cake batter with no lumps.
* Evenly distribute the cake batter between the two lined cake pans, and bake in the pre-heated oven at 355 ºF (180 ºC) for about 40 minutes or until spongy to the touch and an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
* Allow to cool.

### Frosting

* In a stand mixer, or using a hand mixer with the double beater attachments, beat the butter for 2 - 3 minutes, until pale and fluffy.
* Add the powdered sugar, and beat for a further 5 minutes.
* Add the cocoa powder and salt, and beat until evenly distributed in the buttercream.
* Add in the melted (and cooled) dark chocolate, and beat until you get a rich, fluffy chocolate frosting with an even chocolate brown colour.
