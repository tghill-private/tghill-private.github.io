https://www.snixykitchen.com/gluten-free-dumpling-wrappers/

## Ingredients

### Wrappers

 * 2 1/2 cups gluten free flour blend
 * 1 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
 * 1 cup + 1 tbsp warm water

NOTE: You can also use an egg dough, see perogies.

### Filling - Pork and Cabbage Potstickers

 * 1 tbsp oil
 * 1 1/2 cups finely chopped green cabbage
 * 2 tbsp minced garlic (~3 cloves?)
 * 2 tbsp minced ginger
 * 1/4 cup chopped onions
 * 1 tsp salt
 * 1 lb ground pork
 * 2 tbsp soy sauce
 * 1/2 tsp sesame oil
 * 1 tsp mirin


## Instructions

 * Saute onions, cabbage, ginger, and garlic for about 2 minutes, until it begins to soften
 * Remove vegetables; cook and drain meat
 * Combine meat, vegetables, and seasonings in a large bowl. Set aside for dumpling filling

### Wrappers

 * Whisk together flour and xanthan gum. Pour in water and mix until it comes together
 * Knead by hand or stir in a bowl until the dough becomes smooth. Add flour as necessary to reach a texture that is easy to work with
 * Roll out and shape as you would perogies

### Assembling

 * Option 1: Fill and seal like perogies :)
 * Option 2: See directions [here](https://healthynibblesandbits.com/pork-and-cabbage-potstickers/)

### Cooking

Option 1:

 * Pan-fry dumplings in oil until golden brown
 * Add 1/4 cup of water to the pan, cover and cook for 5-6 minutes
 * Remove lid, cook until water evaporates

Option 2:

 * Boil like with perogies :)

## Notes

To freeze dumplings for later use: Place dumplings on parchament on a baking sheet in the freezer for at least an hour. Once the dumpling wrappers feel firm, you can transfer the dumplings to a freezer-safe storage bag. Cook frozen dumplings straight out of the freezer without defrosting.
