# Bagels
Homemade Bagels, Ã  la Jo Goldenberg Recipe. Makes ~8 bagels

## Ingredients

* 18 oz bread flour1
* 2 1/2 tsp yeast
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp salt
* 12 oz hot water
* 1.5 tbsp malt syrup/sugar
* Egg wash and toppings

## Preparation

* Make dough, rise to double (~1 hour)
* Boil water and preheat oven to 400F
* Divide into eight or ten, shape
* Boil 30+ seconds each side
* Remove, let dry briefly
* Brush with egg wash and top
* Bake at 400 F for 20-25 min

NOTE: The recipe calls for 19.25 oz of bread flour, but it usually turns out too dry when I add that much. I usually start with ~17 oz, and add more a little at a time until I reach a good hydration level.
